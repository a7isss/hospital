To determine which environment variables might be causing a build error, I will analyze the variables based on their typical usage in applications and common issues that arise from incorrect configurations.

JWT_SECRET: This is crucial for authentication and authorization. If this is incorrect, it can lead to issues with token generation and verification, causing build errors related to user authentication.

ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD: These are used for admin access. If they are incorrect, it may not cause a build error but could lead to issues when trying to log in as an admin.

CLOUDINARY_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY: These are essential for image uploads and management. If any of these are incorrect, it can lead to errors when trying to upload or access images.

RAZORPAY_KEY_ID and RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET: These are necessary for payment processing. Incorrect values can lead to failures in payment transactions, but may not directly cause build errors.

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Similar to Razorpay, this is needed for payment processing. Incorrect values can lead to transaction failures.

CURRENCY: This is less likely to cause a build error but could lead to issues in payment processing if the currency is not supported.

PORT: If not set correctly, it can cause the server to fail to start, leading to build errors.

Based on this analysis, I will provide a prioritized list of variables that should be checked for correctness, starting with the most likely to cause build errors.

I will now present this information to the user.
